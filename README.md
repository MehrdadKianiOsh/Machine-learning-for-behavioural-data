# How models for knowledge tracing depend on data

This project is done for the CS-421 course 'Machine learning for behavioural data' at EPFL using [*Lernavi*](https://www.lernnavi.ch/) dataset:
- Tikhon Parshikov
- Mehrdad Kiani Oshtorjani

## Project structure
**Folders** <br>
- Folder [experiments](experiments) consists of two directories: [subjects](experiments/subjects) and [topics](experiments/topics) with notebooks we used to run -experiments on two data sets with corresponding names. 
- Folder [data exploration](data_exploration) consists of notebooks with individual analysis of data set from [*Lernavi*](https://www.lernnavi.ch/). 
- Folder [data](data) consists of files we used in our work (except *events.csv.gz* due to its volume).

**Notebooks** <br>
- [Subjects](lernavi_subjects_template.ipynb) is a notebook with template we used in our experiments with *subjects* data set.
- [Topics](lernavi_topics_template.ipynb) is a notebook with template we used in our experiments with *topics* data set.

**Assets** <br>
- [Poster](Poster.pdf) is a poster we used to present our project on in poster session.
